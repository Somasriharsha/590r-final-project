The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy (OPT) dataset is a multicenter randomized clinical trial study, to study whether the nonsurgical periodontal treatment during pregnancy reduces the risk of preterm birth. A total of 823 pregnant participants (enrolled at 13â€“16 weeks of gestation) were randomized at four U.S. centers to receive periodontal therapy during pregnancy (treatment) or after delivery (control). The data has the baseline risk factors (Age, BMI, Education), health behaviors (tobacco/alcohol use), periodontal clinical measures (pocket depth averages at multiple visits), essential dental care indicators, and obstetrical outcomes (gestational age, birthweight). This repository uses a de-identified teaching version of the OPT data.
